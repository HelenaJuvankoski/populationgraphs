# Population graph
Simple frontend app to show [World Bank population data](https://data.worldbank.org/). The app was designed for Mimmit Koodaa MOOC by Sympa in collaboration with my co-workers Mikko Kotola and Irene Koskinen. My responsibility was to help and advise the participants with the visual styling possibilities.

## How to install
No need to install anything. This is a simple frontend app using data from open REST APIs.

## How to run locally
Open index.html-file (in public-folder) using a browser.

## How it works
Frontend fetches the data from the World Bank REST API serving World Bank open population data and visualizes it using Chart.js. The user enters the country code for the country and is then shown the visualization as a graph.
